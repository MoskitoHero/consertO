#ReadMe
Yes, please, do.

##Disclaimer: This is personal stuff
This is a personal attempt at creating a PHP MVC Framework for my personal use, on small websites and blogs for clients.

It is also an attempt at understanding better how this whole stuff works, by creating my own.

Don't use this in production. Or do. But you're warned. Feel feel to fork, and all !

##Documentation
When this framework gets stable and secure enough, I'll write something down as a quick documentation, if anyone's interested.

##Uses
This tiny PHP MVC Framework uses [RedBeanPHP](http://www.redbeanphp.com/) and [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) as libraries.
