<h1>Welcome to the Skin&Bones Framework !</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Disclaimer: This is personal stuff</h1>
<p>This is a personal attempt at creating a PHP MVC Framework for my personal use, on small websites and blogs for clients.</p>
<p>It is also an attempt at understanding better how this whole stuff works, by creating my own.</p>
<p>Don't use this in production. Or do. But you're warned. Feel feel to fork, and all !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Documentation</h1>
<p>When this framework gets stable and secure enough, I'll write something down as a quick documentation, if anyone's interested.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Uses</h1>
<p>This tiny PHP MVC Framework uses RedBeanPHP and Twig as libraries.</p>
